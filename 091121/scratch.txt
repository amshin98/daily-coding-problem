- Isn't this just bfs? I think it goes:
  - If root, print self
  - Print left child if exists
  - Print right child if exists
  - Call BFS on left child if exists
  - Call BFS on right child if exists

- Nope it'd just go down the left side

- I vaguely remember something about stacks for dfs and queues for bfs
  - Initialize queue
  - Enqueue root node
  - While queue not empty
    - Poll and print
    - Enqueue left child then right child

- Thank you past self for making test utils and a BST
