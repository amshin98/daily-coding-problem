===== Serialize =====
- First thought: do this how we did heaps in 202 (using a list)
  - Each place in the list is a node, with the root at index 1 (0 is unused)
  - Left child is at index 2n
  - Right child is at index (2n) + 1
  - None can be used as an empty spot? I'd rather use "EMPTY" or something
  - What delimiter should we use? Since we don't know anything about the
    input data and the example doesn't use spaces let's just do that


- Some specifics:
  - The value of the Node is stored in the string
  - Space delimited
  - "EMPTY" is used for blank spots

- Resizing list: we can do what we did in C and do new size = current size * 2
  - list.extend(<what to add at the end>)

- Wow this keeps getting more complicated

- Keep track of current node's index via a recursive parameter

- TIL len() is O(1) so we don't need to keep track of size as a parameter (phew)

===== Deserialize =====
- First thought: recursively build and return nodes
  - Base case: No children, return node containing current value
  - Otherwise, return node containing current value, left child as recursive call on
    value at idx 2 * cur_idx, right child as recursive call on 2 * cur_idx
    - Build left and right child first, then assign to current node so we can check
      if EMPTY

- After writing some code I simplified it into what it is now
